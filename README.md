## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd resulta

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the app with web preview
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## Custom Development Builds

For advanced native features, you'll need to create a Custom Development Build instead of using Expo Go.

### **When do you need a Custom Development Build?**

- **Native Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In, Google Sign In
- **In-App Purchases**: App Store and Google Play subscriptions
- **Advanced Native Features**: Third-party SDKs, platform-specifc features (e.g. Widgets on iOS)
- **Background Processing**: Background tasks, location tracking

### **Creating a Custom Development Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```

For mobile apps, you'll configure your app's deep linking scheme in `app.config.js`.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Try using tunnel mode: `bun start -- --tunnel`
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

### **Build failing?**

1. Clear your cache: `bunx expo start --clear`
2. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
3. Check [Expo's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/build-errors/)
